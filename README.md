# Introduction
This repo accompanies the [blog post](https://lavanya.ai/searching-for-dark-matter/) I wrote about searching for traces of dark matter in data produced by CERN.

I’ve recently been having a lot of fun playing with the Large Hadron Collider datasets, and I thought I’ll share some of the things I’ve learnt along the way. The 2 main things I’ll be exploring in this post are:

- **Particle identification**: training a classifier to detect electrons, protons, muons, kaons and pions
- **Searching for dark matter**: training a classifier to distinguish between background noise and the signal, and then applying clustering algorithms to find potential traces of dark matter in this signal

You can get more background by reading the blog post here: https://lavanya.ai/searching-for-dark-matter/
You can also get this code as a Kaggle kernel here: https://www.kaggle.com/lavanyashukla01/searching-for-dark-matter/

PS: I would love to hear what you think about the post and the kernel, and any suggestions you have for how I can improve it! This repo is a WIP. I'll add to it over the next few weeks as I explore the dataset further. Thank you Coursera for presenting some of the ideas that inspired this repo!
